# friend-finder

FriendFinder is a full stack application that allows an user to find the best match for them based on the answer of their questions. The theme for this app is finding a special agent from one of the federal agency that is the best match for the user. This site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.
